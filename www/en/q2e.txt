A: The files that you have orderd will be sent to you via e-mail. The files that you will receive can be opened only by a CAD program, that’s why we will make a dozen of photos of your sketch to make sure that the design that we have made is what you have wanted. Of course If you are not satisfied with the photos of your sketch you can always visit a K.P. Industries office and our colleagues will help you review your files.
